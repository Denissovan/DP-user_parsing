* Installed libraries in requirements.txt - pip install -r requirements.txt

## Jupyeter notebook content :

The notebook is divided into 3 main parts:

* Parsing

* Matching experiment


## Running the code :

Before running the code at the beginning of the Parsing section change the **local_root_folder_path** to the path where you have the **code** folder of the digital part of the work located (aka. digitalna_cast_prace/code). Example => local_root_folder_path = "your_path_location_of_the_digital_part_of_work\digitalna_cast_prace\code".
Then you can run the Jupyter notebook that is situated in the *digitalna_cast_prace/code/parsing_module2* path.
